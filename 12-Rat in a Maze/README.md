# Rat in a Maze problem
This code traverse a **2D-Maze** using backtracking to find the path from any starting point inside the maze to the exit.
### Notes:
* y represents the y-axis, x represents the x-axis.
* y is used for vertical movement (up and down) and its boundary is the number of rows.
* x is used for horizontal movement (right and left) and its boundary is the number of columns.
* Enter the dimensions no. of rows then no. of columns.
* Enter the Maze '1' represents a wall and '0' represents a path.
